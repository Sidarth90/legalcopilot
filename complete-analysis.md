## Final Recommendations

### Strategic Pivot from Original Plan
**From:** B2B legal tool competing with Spellbook/DraftPilot
**To:** B2C contract explainer with ad revenue model

**Reasoning:**
1. **Market size:** B2C market 150x larger than B2B ($14B vs $90M)
2. **Competition:** No direct free competitors vs saturated B2B space
3. **Validation:** Strong Reddit evidence of contract confusion epidemic
4. **Monetization:** Immediate ad revenue vs long B2B sales cycles
5. **Viral potential:** B2C tools get shared, B2B tools don't

### Recommended MVP: Free Contract Explainer + Ads
**Single core feature:** Upload contract → Plain English explanation → Ad revenue

**Target users (prioritized):**
1. Small business owners (highest value per user)
2. Individual consumers (highest volume)
3. Freelancers/contractors (regular usage)
4. Small law firms (premium tier opportunity)

**Revenue projection Week 1:** $855-2,105
**Break-even:** 15-20 contracts explained per day

### Success Metrics & Milestones
**Week 1:** 100+ contracts processed, $100+ revenue
**Month 1:** 1,000+ contracts processed, $1,000+ revenue
