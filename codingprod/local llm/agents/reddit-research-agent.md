```

### Solution Compilation
```markdown
## Community Solutions Summary

### Most Recommended Approach (from r/LocalLLaMA):
1. **Use transformers library** with CPU backend (most stable)
2. **Start with Llama 3.2 1B** (best speed/quality balance)
3. **Install Intel Extension for PyTorch** (30% speed boost)
4. **Use Q4_K_M quantization** (memory efficient)

### Common Setup Issues & Solutions:
- **Problem**: PyTorch Intel GPU not detected
  **Solution**: Install Intel GPU drivers first, then intel-extension-for-pytorch
  
- **Problem**: Out of memory errors
  **Solution**: Use dynamic loading, process text in chunks
  
- **Problem**: Slow inference on CPU
  **Solution**: Set OMP_NUM_THREADS to match CPU cores
